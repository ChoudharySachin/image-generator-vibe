Aspect ratio 16:9 (1920x1080). Use soft, blended colors with gentle transitions (watercolor palette: soft blues, pinks, yellows). Colorful textured background with watercolor wash effects (light blues blending into soft pinks or yellows). Elements should blend naturally at edges while maintaining distinct forms that represent the concept. ALL ELEMENTS CENTERED, artistic composition. Gentle, artistic aesthetic. CRITICAL: NO text, NO characters, NO labels, NO numbers. Mathematically accurate representation only.\n\nFINAL CRITICAL REMINDER:\n- Do NOT include \"Pythagoras theorem, year 8\" as text anywhere in the image\n- Do NOT include \"Year 8\" as text anywhere in the image  \n- Do NOT include ANY words, labels, or text of any kind\n- Do NOT include elements unrelated to \"Pythagoras theorem, year 8\"\n- Show ONLY the minimal visual representation of \"Pythagoras theorem, year 8\"\n", "response_time": 15.178545951843262, "success": true}}
