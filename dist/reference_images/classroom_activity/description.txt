## PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR GENERATION

Use this template when generating classroom activity images:

```
Create a vibrant, illustrated scene showing diverse students collaborating on [ACTIVITY: "{learning_activity}"] in a modern classroom setting.

Aspect ratio 1500:1060 (landscape).

Students (2-4 students):
- Diverse group: varied ethnicities, genders, appearances
- Age: [AGE: "middle school/high school"] (12-17 years)
- Expressions: Engaged, enthusiastic, focused, collaborative
- Clothing: Casual contemporary school attire, varied colors
- Body language: Leaning in, gesturing, pointing, actively participating
- Interaction: Discussing, sharing ideas, working together

Setting & Environment:
- Modern classroom or collaborative learning space
- Contemporary desks/tables with students gathered around
- Learning materials: notebooks, tablets/laptops, textbooks
- Background: Soft, muted (bookshelves, windows, educational posters - blurred)
- Clean, organized, welcoming space

Learning Activity:
- Students working on {learning_activity}
- Visible materials related to the activity (worksheets, screens, whiteboard)
- Mathematical content visible but not overwhelming
- Tools: calculators, rulers, tablets, markers as appropriate
- Clear focus on collaborative problem-solving

Color Palette:
- Vibrant, energetic colors: bright blue (#3498DB), warm orange (#E67E22), fresh green (#27AE60)
- Diverse natural skin tones
- Varied colorful clothing
- Soft muted background (cream, light gray, soft blue)
- Pops of bright color in learning materials

Composition:
- Students in foreground (60-70% of frame)
- Clustered around shared workspace
