# SUBTOPIC COVER IMAGES - STYLE GUIDE & PROMPT TEMPLATE

## Visual Style Analysis (Based on Reference Images)

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Style**: Minimal, flat 3D illustration with paper-craft aesthetic
- **Composition**: Perfectly centered, layered flat elements with subtle depth
- **Background**: Clean off-white/cream background
- **Shadows**: Soft, subtle shadows creating gentle depth
- **Texture**: Matte finish, smooth surfaces

### Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**: Muted pastels
  - Soft blue (#A8D5E2, #B8E6F0)
  - Mint green (#B8E6D5, #C8F0E0)
  - Coral pink (#F0B8C8, #FFD0DC)
  - Butter yellow (#FFE8B8, #FFF4D0)
  - Light cream (#FFF8F0, #FFFAF5)
- **Accent Colors**: Slightly deeper versions of pastels for contrast
- **Avoid**: Bright, saturated colors; dark or heavy tones

### Design Elements
- **Shapes**: Geometric, soft-edged shapes (circles, rounded rectangles, curves)
- **Layering**: 2-4 layers of overlapping elements
- **Mathematical Elements**: Abstract representations (no complex equations)
  - Simple geometric patterns
  - Flowing curves and lines
  - Symbolic shapes representing concepts
- **Depth**: Achieved through layering and soft shadows, not gradients

### Typography (When Needed)
- **Usage**: ONLY for algebra skills or when absolutely necessary
- **Style**: Clean, modern sans-serif
- **Integration**: Minimal, integrated into the design
- **Default**: NO TEXT for most subtopics

### Composition Rules
- **Alignment**: All elements perfectly centered
- **Balance**: Symmetrical or balanced asymmetry
- **Spacing**: Generous negative space
- **Focus**: Single clear focal point

## PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR GENERATION

Use this template when generating subtopic cover images:

```
Create a minimal, flat 3D illustration representing [SUBTOPIC: "{subtopic_name}"] for [YEAR LEVEL: "{year_level}"]. 

Aspect ratio 16:9 (1920x1080).

Visual Style:
- Soft matte geometric shapes with subtle depth and shadows
- Muted pastel color palette: soft blue, mint green, coral pink, butter yellow, light cream
- Clean off-white/cream background
- Paper-craft aesthetic with layered flat elements
- 2-4 layers of overlapping shapes creating gentle depth

Composition:
- All elements perfectly centered
- Generous negative space
- Symmetrical or balanced layout
- Single clear focal point

Design Elements:
- Abstract geometric shapes representing the mathematical concept
- Flowing curves and soft-edged forms
- Subtle shadows for depth (no harsh shadows)
- Smooth, matte surfaces

Style Guidelines:
- Friendly, modern, educational aesthetic
- Clean and uncluttered
- Mathematically accurate representation
- Professional yet approachable

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- NO text, NO characters, NO labels, NO numbers (unless algebra-specific)
- NO complex equations or formulas
- NO photorealistic elements
- Focus on abstract, symbolic representation
```

## VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION

When generating, replace these placeholders:
- `{subtopic_name}`: The specific subtopic (e.g., "Unit Fractions", "True Bearing", "Quadratic Equations")
- `{year_level}`: The educational level (e.g., "Year 7", "Year 10", "Grade 8")

---

## EXAMPLES FROM REFERENCE IMAGES

### Example 1: Unit Fractions
- Central circular element divided into segments
- Soft pink and cream colors
- Layered circular shapes creating depth
- Perfectly centered composition
- No text or numbers

### Example 2: True Bearing
- Compass-like circular design
- Directional elements with soft curves
- Blue and cream color scheme
- Geometric precision with soft aesthetic
- Abstract representation of navigation concepts
